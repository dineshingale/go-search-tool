# 🔍 Fast-Search CLI (Go)

A high-performance command-line utility built in **Go** for lightning-fast file discovery across your system.

## 🚀 Why this project?
Standard file searches can be slow and resource-heavy. This utility uses Go's efficient file-walking capabilities to scan thousands of directories in milliseconds. It demonstrates a clean **Modular Architecture** by separating CLI logic from the core search engine.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Ensure you have **Go 1.21+** installed.
2. Clone the repository and run:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
